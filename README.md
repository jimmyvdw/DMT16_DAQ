# Design Make and Test Group 16

## Project Brief

The aim of this project is..

* Produce a test rig capable of measuring..
* Compare the measured results to CFD to verify the simulations

## The aim of this subgroup - DMT16 DAQ

Our subgroup was created in order to deal with the wide range of electronic demands of the project. The main tasks were:

* To produce an intuitive GUI which allowed the user to control the initial conditions and boundary conditions
* To install and synchronise all of the measurements such that a time reference can be assigned to each measurement
* To control the actuators in order to produce the desired transient boundary conditions

### Code Structure

The code was split into 3 parts:

- The data transmission circuit and actuators
- The PICO Data logger
- The GUI interface

## System Design

Below we will cover the rough groundwork
